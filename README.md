SpeedUnitDisplay

This is very simple KSP mod to change your "Surface" speed indicator to a combined one,
which includes four values: your real speed in km/h as well as IAS in km/h
and it still keeps your speed value in m/s, as well as adding IAS in m/s.
No clicks, no changes, no configuration required.

Inspired and based on SpeedUnitChanger, which is licensed under GPLv3 and derives this license.

Currently it is unknown if it is working with Ferram Aerospace Research properly (in terms of IAS value).
